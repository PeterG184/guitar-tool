# Guitar Tool (Working Title)

In trying to develop my listening ability and learn chords/scales I've found a lot of pretty good sites that do their thing well, be it showing a plethora of scales, teaching all the positions of chords or ear training, but I haven't found a site that does all of them in a way that I like. Instead of criticising the other sites baselessly, I decided to have a go at it.

## Planned Featureset
- Chord Positions
  - A visual demonstration of any given chord across all possible shapes (hopefully achieved dynamically)
- Scales
  - A visual demonstration of all positions of any givens scale from any given starting note (hopefully achieved dynamically)
- Ear Training
  - Random note picker/player with timer for the user to guess what note has been played
- Chord/Scale Harmoniser
  - Scale suggestions for a given set of chords
- Chord/Chord Harmoniser
  - Chord suggestions for a given set of chords
- Note/Pitch Recognition (tuner effectively to begin with)
  - Allowing for the user to plug their instrument into the tool to tune, and later be used in other features.
